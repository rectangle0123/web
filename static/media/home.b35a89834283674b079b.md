# About this site

_September 23, 2023_

## Greetings

This website is a non-work-related web project created by me, a professional in the field of system development.

I realized that when attempting to publish my hobby-made app on the store, I need to prepare a web page with a privacy policy statement.
In order to fulfill this requirement, I initially planned to create a standalone web page. However, I decided to turn it into a portfolio-style website where I can also showcase other articles and content.

I'm looking forward to sharing various 'playful' accomplishments here.
